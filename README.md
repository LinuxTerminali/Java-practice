1)Kangaroo-;There are two kangaroos on an x-axis ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). 
The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate ofv1  meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location x2  and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll ever land at the same location at the same time?


2)Logaan-; Logan is cleaning his apartment. In particular, he must sort his old favorite sequence,P ,N of  positive integers in nondecreasing order. He's tired from a long day, so he invented an easy way (in his opinion) to do this job. His algorithm can be described by the following pseudocode:

while isNotSorted(P) do {   
    WaitOneMinute();
    RandomShuffle(P)
}
Can you determine the expected number of minutes that Logan will spend waiting for  to be sorted?
